Personal journal for security learnings, I aim to post every day

Sat, Jan 8:

- I did an hour of working on PicoCTF today. I spent a while on the Cookies challenge. Having tried a bunch of other stuff (including seeing if there's some non-GET or POST HTTP method I need to use), I feel fairly confident that it's supposed to be SQL injection. However, none of the typical SQL injection things seem to be working... So I'll probably need to be more creative. So far I've been assuming the query looks something like "SELECT xxx FROM yyy WHERE zzz = query", but perhaps the format is rather different. I moved on to later picoCTF challenges, and did a few very easy ones. No particular learnings unfortunately, except that I got to use Postman for the first time in a while.

- I did 20 minutes of PicoCTF today. Ben Lee kindly gave me two hints on the Cookies one. I can't believe I didn't think of editing the cookie!

Mon, Jan 10:

- I did an hour of PicoCTF today. Worked on the Easy Peasy problem about OTP. I can see that the key is used in a rotating manner, and I'm able to consistently "see" a given part of the key, I think... since I can try spamming different kinds of chars and still see a consistent result in the key. However, looks like I'm peeking at the wrong part of the key since I'm not getting anything useful when I xor my key section with the encrypted flag. I also noticed that the key seems to consist mostly of ascii chars saying \xad\x0f etc, which is interesting but may not be useful.

- I did around 40 min of learning about log4j today. I read about the vulnerability, which was very easy to understand. I then tried to learn how to replicate the vulnerability. I'm going to first aim to just replicate the basic dns vulnerability, before trying any corrupted LDAP shenanigans. First thing to do is to set up a Java web server on my own machine, so I spent most of the time getting started with that.
