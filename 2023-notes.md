- Sorry haven't written in a while. I realized that my understanding of basic IT and networking is lacking, so I'm trying to brush up on this before getting more hands on. Trying to go through Daniel Miessler's recommendations for IT tasks to get comfortable with. With some Azure VM's I have gotten through the first few bullets: setting up an Active Directory forest with a corresponding DNS and DHCP server (though DHCP doesn't work in Azure since it's provided by the infrastructure).
- I was going to begin on "setting up multiple network zones" but I'm not sure what this entails and Googling didn't seem to help. If I had to do it right now I'd only know to manually configure Windows Firewall rules to do this. I think I probably need to understand this task better first.
- Right now I'm learning about routing basics. I learned some of this in undergrad but haven't used it and forgot some of it.
- Today I reviewed NAT and port forwarding and logged into my home router for the first time. So port forwarding seems similar to NAT in that both are passing traffic from external hosts to internal hosts through the router, and the router is translating the external traffic's destination (which is a port on the router) to the correct internal destination. However, a distinction is that NAT assignments are temporary and not publicly discoverable, whereas port forwarding is meant as a long-lived setting which enables a service running on an internal server to be publicly accessible.
- I also understood DHCP better after reading about how to set static IP's. In short it should be set from the DHCP server itself. In my Azure case that'll probably instead be through the web UI, though I think right now I'm setting it to request a certain IP from the DHCP server, on the network settings of the machine itself (have to double check).
